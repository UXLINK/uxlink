## Overview

Social Growth Protocols is a unified on-chain points mechanism for Dapp growth.

## What's Social Growth Protocols

UXLINK has introduced Social Growth Protocols, consisting of three protocols:

* X2EARN Protocol

* Social Group Protocol

* Social Graph Protocol

## X2EARN Protocol

After users complete interactions in various Dapps within the UXLINK ecosystem, they can securely and effectively verify these activities within the UXLINK account system, earning Universal Points (UXUY) provided by UXLINK.

## What's Universal Points (UXUY)
UXLINK offers a unique incentive mechanism called Universal Points (UXUY). Universal Points are designed to reward users for completing interaction tasks within Dapps that use One Account. With Universal Points (UXUY), project owners can boost user engagement, creating an effective incentive loop.

By leveraging the Universal Points incentive mechanism and the X2Earn Protocol, UXLINK can provide Dapp project owners with real, effective social data and on-chain behavior data. X2Earn Protocol records users’ interactions within the Dapp, transforming them into verifiable social data and on-chain interaction data.

### Social Group Protocol

Social Group Protocol is an on-chain abstraction of the web2 social groups that offers a social growth mechanism for Dapps which in UXLINK ecosystem.

### Social Graph Protocol

Social Graph Protocol is an on-chain abstraction of the users's social connections that offers a social growth mechanism for Dapps which in UXLINK ecosystem.


## Conclusion

As we continue advancing decentralized finance and user incentives, UXLINK offers developers a multi-layered "X to Earn" mining mechanism aimed at stimulating Dapp user growth and enhancing Dapp activity levels.
The "X to Earn" multi-layered mining system, built on Social Growth Protocols, provides users with additional incentives and ways to participate. This not only increases users’ engagement in on-chain interactions but also offers Dapps new avenues for user growth. UXLINK is committed to building a more vibrant decentralized ecosystem, creating greater value for users and developers alike.
