## UXLINK Account

UXLINK Account serves as the foundation of the One Account abstraction protocol, incorporating Social Accounts Abstraction and On-Chain Accounts Abstraction:

### Social Accounts Abstraction (Off-Chain Accounts Abstraction)

Social Accounts Abstraction means that UXLINK Account can consolidate a user‚Äôs social media accounts (e.g., Telegram, X (Twitter), Line, Kakao Talk, WhatsApp, Facebook, TikTok, etc.) into a single virtual account, allowing unified management and authentication of these accounts. Users can login, authenticate, and interact through their social accounts, making it easy to switch identities across platforms and offering a cross-platform interaction experience.

### On-Chain Accounts Abstraction

On-Chain Accounts Abstraction refers to UXLINK Account‚Äôs support for unified abstraction of blockchain accounts, enabling users to manage their on-chain accounts across different blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Arbitrum, Mantle, TON, KAIA, BTC L2, Solona etc.) without directly handling the technical complexities of on-chain operations. With UXLINK Account, users can simplify on-chain transactions, asset management, and more.

## Conclusion

‚ÄúOne Account‚Äù is a core feature of UXLINK, integrating users‚Äô social and on-chain accounts to provide a single account gateway across the Web2 and Web3 worlds. This abstraction and integration not only allow users to log into Dapps seamlessly but also enable secure, fast interaction across both blockchain and traditional internet platforms using a unified account.
